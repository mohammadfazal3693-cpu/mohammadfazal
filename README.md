## About Me

I’m a Computer Science student focused on building strong engineering fundamentals and scalable backend systems.

Currently working on:

- Solving Data Structures & Algorithms problems consistently
- Building REST APIs using Spring Boot
- Understanding system design and scalable architectures

I believe great engineering is built on clarity, consistency, and depth — not just learning many technologies.
